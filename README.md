## System Introduction
In this project, we aim to explore the relationship between the QS world university rankings and the cost of living index in the locations where these universities are situated. 

## Tools
D3.js

## Conclusion
According to our results, there is no significant correlation between QS rankings and the cost of living in the corresponding locations. This suggests that a university’s position in the QS ranking does not necessarily imply higher or lower living expenses for students. Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between academic reputation and QS ranking, which is consistent with expectations given that academic reputation is a key component in the QS ranking methodology.
